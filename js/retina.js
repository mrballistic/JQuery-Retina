/*

retina jquery plugin

In the presence of a retina display, this script runs through all images, finds out if there's a 2x version, then swaps them out.

Requires a @2x version of the asset to sit next to the original asset, and height/width to be constrained either by the original img tag or the surrounding div.

So: 
	img.png
	img@2x.png
	
	<img src="img.png" height="100" width="100" />
	
	$(document).retina();
